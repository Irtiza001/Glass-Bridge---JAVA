Glass Bridge Game

A ""Glass Bridge Game"" developed in ""Java"", inspired by the popular survival challenge concept. The game challenges players to cross a glass bridge by making calculated decisions to step on the correct tiles without falling through.

🕹️ Game Description

The Glass Bridge Game is an engaging and fun project where players must navigate across a series of glass panels. Only some panels are strong enough to support the player, while others will break when stepped on, causing the player to fall. The goal is to reach the other side of the bridge by selecting the correct sequence of panels.

Features:
  Interactive Gameplay: Players choose tiles to progress across the bridge.
  Randomized Patterns: Each playthrough has a different sequence of safe tiles, making the game unpredictable and exciting.
  Player Feedback: Visual cues show success or failure for each step.
  Simple GUI: Intuitive design for easy understanding and navigation.
